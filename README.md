---------------------------------------

Compilation
-----------

- Download & Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tenjava/Ollywood-t2`
- Compile and create the plugin package using Maven: `mvn`

Maven will download all required dependencies and build a ready-for-use plugin package! I think!

---------------------------------------

Usage
-----

1. Install plugin
2. Do things with it

This plugin will add a cool new mini-game to Minecraft thats focused on user configuration!.
When using the command /finditems, it will start a timer (specified time in config.yml) in which you have to find/mine as many items (configured in config.yml) in a certain amount of time (time in config.yml).

This plugin can be used as a fun little mini-game to play with your friends and see who can get the most items or can be used on a proper server to add a difference to boring monotonous mining. It can also be used as a "boost" for mining on servers.

Things I Forgot
---------------

1. Permissions
2. Cooldown betwwen starting games
